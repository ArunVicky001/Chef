# Clean Architecture iOS App with MVVM and Coordinator Pattern

This iOS application showcases a clean and organized architectural design, combining the power of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern with the flexibility of the Coordinator pattern for navigation.

# Overview

Clean Architecture: The app follows a modular and maintainable code structure based on Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and testability.
MVVM Design Pattern: The Model-View-ViewModel pattern is used to create a clear separation between the UI logic and business logic. This results in a highly modular and testable codebase.
Coordinator Pattern: For navigation and flow control, the Coordinator pattern is employed. This pattern helps in managing navigation and keeps view controllers independent.
